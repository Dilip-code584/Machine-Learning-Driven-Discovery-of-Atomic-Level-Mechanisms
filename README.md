Introduction
Atomic-level mechanisms, such as molecular interactions, diffusion processes, and phase transitions, are fundamental in understanding material properties and chemical reactions. Traditional methods of discovering these mechanisms are often limited by scale and complexity. This project employs machine learning models to predict and identify atomic-level behaviors, enabling researchers to gain insights more efficiently.

Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between molecular simulations and machine learning. By training models on large datasets of atomic simulations, we aim to discover new patterns and predict mechanisms with minimal computational cost. This project can potentially revolutionize how we approach material discovery and chemical reactions.

Methodology
Data Collection: Atomic simulation data (e.g., GROMACS, LAMMPS) were gathered from various open datasets and scientific literature.
Preprocessing: Data was cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for machine learning models.
Model Training: We experimented with several machine learning algorithms including:
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for 3D atomic structures
Evaluation: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, interpretability, and ability to predict mechanisms previously unreported in literature.
Data and Preprocessing
The dataset used in this project includes atomic coordinates, bond angles, energy states, and other relevant atomic features from molecular dynamics simulations. Preprocessing steps involve:

Normalization of atomic coordinates
Removal of outliers
Feature extraction using principal component analysis (PCA) and other techniques
Modeling and Results
We trained multiple models and achieved promising results in terms of:

Prediction Accuracy: Models accurately predicted known atomic mechanisms with high fidelity.
Discovery of New Mechanisms: Preliminary results indicate that the model may have identified new mechanisms worth exploring further.
Performance: The final model demonstrated a 95% accuracy rate on the test set, with high computational efficiency.
Key Results:
Identification of previously unknown diffusion pathways in a copper alloy system.
High prediction accuracy for atomic-level reactions in a simple organic molecule system.
